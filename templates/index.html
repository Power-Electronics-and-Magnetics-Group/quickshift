        QuickSHiFT is a <b>open-source</b> tool designed for the rapid simulation of current distribution in high-frequency transformers. In addition to being able to simulate individual designs, QuickSHiFT can automatically generate winding configurations and analyze them at speeds of thousands-per-second, enabling optimization. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To describe winding configurations, QuickSHiFT uses a binary tree structure. For a given transformer with two windings and <b>N</b> layers, the final encoded representation consists of two binary trees with a cumulative <b>N</b> leaf nodes (nodes that have no sub-trees). These leaf nodes each represent a layer, and must specify two parameters: the layer number (which layer is it, numbered from top to bottom of the stack), and the number of turns on the layer. All remaining nodes on the tree are either 'Parallel' or 'Series' nodes, which, as their names suggest, represent that their child nodes are connected in parallel or series respectively. Note that their child nodes need not be individual layers, but can also be Parallel or Series nodes themselves. As such, the tool can be used to specify parallel connections of series-connected layers as well as series connections of parallel-connected layers (or even more complex configurations).
        <br>
        <br>
        The Evaluator requires inputs to be valid binary trees, and the optimizer outputs candidate designs in the binary tree format. The syntax is straightforward: 
        <ul>
          <li>To specify a parallel connection between nodes A and B: (P,A,B)</li>
          <li>To specify a series connection between nodes A and B: (S,A,B)</li>
          <li>To specify a winding on layer N with M turns: [LN,MT]</li>
        </ul>
        Parallel connections, series connections, and layer specifications are all nodes themselves, and can be chained together to create arbitrarily complex winding configurations.
