==== _loss_ [[id,loss]]

After a current_sharing function is called, this function generates the power loss / power draw coefficient for the resultant tuple that this function returns.

*Parameters*:

[source,python]
----
ff = tuple

# Tuple created by the output of the current_sharing_symbolic/current_sharing_numeric functions. All
# terms are in the form of N Ã— Ip , where N is a real constant. 
----

*Returns*:

The coefficient of the power loss with respect to I~p~. This function assumes the R term is constant for every layer in calculation of the power loss.
