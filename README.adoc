= current-sharing

This project aims to be fully complete in a command-line format and then transferred to a application framework (either a web GUI with Flask/Django/etc. or a software-based GUI with WxPython, etc.?)

== Installation

Instructions for this will be updated when the project is complete 

== Methods

=== currentSharing{score}general



==== _current{score}sharing{score}numeric_
Evaluates current sharing within the specified layer structure & dimensions.

*Parameters*:

[source,python]
----
n = int 
# Total layer number.

pl = list 
# A valid layer list representing the primary winding.

sl = list 
#  A valid layer list representing the secondary winding. Elements in the sl should not be in the pl.

b = float 
# Layer width (m)

f = int 
# Operating frequency (Hz)

l = float
# Turn length (m)

r = float or list(float) 
# Distances between layers (m). Can either be a single value (in which case distances are assumed to be the same) or a list of floats with N-1 entries.

Ip = float 
# Primary current value (A). If it is not specified, will be set to 1.

N_turns = list(int)
# Number of turns of each layer. Should have N entries. If not specified, all layers will be assumed to have 1 layer each.
----

*Returns*:
``X``

A 3×N by 1 vector, with the first N entries representing the current in layers 1 through N, and the next 2×N entries representing the surface current densities in each layer (starting from the top of the structure and moving down).

'''

==== _current{score}sharing{score}symbolic_
Evaluates current sharing within the specified layer structure & dimensions.

*Parameters*:

[source,python]
----
n = int 
# Total layer number.

pl = list 
# A valid layer list representing the primary winding.

sl = list 
#  A valid layer list representing the secondary winding. Elements in the sl should not be in the pl.

N_turns = list(int)
# Number of turns of each layer. Should have N entries. If not specified, all layers will be assumed to have 1 layer each.

distanceFlag = bool
# 0 if all interlayer distances should be treated as the same. 1 otherwise.
----

*Returns*:
``X``

A 3×N by 1 vector, with the first N entries representing the current in layers 1 through N, and the next 2×N entries representing the surface current densities in each layer (starting from the top of the structure and moving down).

'''

==== _valid{score}layer{score}list_

*Parameters*:

[source,python]
----
node = int or list
# A potential layer list.

N = int
#  Total number of layers.
----

*Returns*:
``1`` if the layer list is valid, and ``0`` if it is not valid. A valid layer list can have three acceptable entries: an integer (of value between 1 and N inclusive), a series list ``(['s',  valid list, valid list])``, or a parallel list ``(['p', valid list, valid list])``.

'''

==== _primary{score}current{score}identity_

*Parameters*:

[source,python]
----
node = int or list
# A valid layer list or layer number

N = int
#  Total number of layers.
----

*Returns*:
``identity`` 

A list representing a primary current equality, with the left hand side of the equality implied to be nonzero.

'''

==== _traverse{score}layer{score}list_

Returns a list of lists, with each inner list representing either a Faraday loop between paralleled layers or a series current identity between series connected layers.

*Parameters*:

[source,python]
----
node = int or list
# A valid layer list or layer number.

N = int
# Total number of layers.

d = float
# Skin depth

bOverL = float
# Ratio of layer width to turn length.

R = float or float list
# Distances between layers. Can either be a single value (in which case distances are assumed to be the same) or a list of floats with N-1 entries.

N_turns = int list
# Number of turns of each layer. Should have N entries. If not specified, all layers will be assumed to have 1 layer each.

array = list
# Top level calls should pass in an empty list.
----

*Returns*:
``array`` 

A list of lists, with each inner list representing either a Faraday loop between paralleled layers or a series current identity between series connected layers.
